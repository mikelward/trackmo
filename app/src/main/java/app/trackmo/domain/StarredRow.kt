/**
 * The stable identity of a **starred row** — the three parts that uniquely identify a
 * [DepartureRow] (SPEC D8): the [stopId], the [lineId] (a *service* is a line at a stop),
 * and the resolved [directionKey] ([DepartureRow.directionKey]: TfL `direction`, else
 * platform, else destination). Keying on the resolved direction key — not raw `direction`
 * — means a star restores to exactly one row even when TfL omits `direction` and two rows
 * would otherwise share a blank one: stop and service disambiguate across rows, and the
 * resolved key keeps blank-`direction` fallback siblings at one stop apart.
 *
 * A star is **ranking, not membership** (SPEC D8): it reorders its row to the top of the
 * list, it does not decide what is shown — that is the watched-stop set. So this carries
 * only the identity, no display fields; the row it pins to is matched fresh each render.
 * Persisted so a star survives restart; it rides Android backup/transfer with the rest of
 * the user's config (SPEC *Privacy* backup note), never an app-initiated send.
